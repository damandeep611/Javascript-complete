Color Conversion:

Add functionality to convert between HEX, RGB, and HSL formats.
Implement custom algorithms for these conversions without using built-in functions.
This will improve your understanding of color theory and mathematical operations in JavaScript.


Color Palette Generator:

Generate a harmonious color palette based on the current color.
Implement different harmony rules like complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.
This will teach you about color theory and more complex algorithmic thinking.


Save and Load Palettes:

Allow users to save their favorite colors or palettes.
Use localStorage or IndexedDB to persist data across sessions.
This introduces you to client-side storage and data management.


Undo/Redo Functionality:

Implement undo and redo for color changes.
This will teach you about managing state and working with arrays or stacks.


Accessibility Features:

Add a contrast checker to ensure text readability on the generated background color.
Provide keyboard navigation for all features.
This introduces you to web accessibility principles and DOM manipulation.


Color Picker from Image:

Allow users to upload an image and pick colors from it.
Use the Canvas API to extract pixel data.
This will teach you about file handling and image processing in JavaScript.


RESTful API Integration:

Create an API endpoint that returns random colors or palettes.
Implement a feature to fetch colors from this API.
This introduces you to AJAX, Promises, and API integration.


Gradient Generator:

Extend your color flipper to generate gradients with multiple color stops.
Allow users to adjust the position and color of each stop.
This will deepen your understanding of CSS manipulation through JavaScript.


Color Naming Algorithm:

Implement an algorithm to find the closest named color to the generated color.
This will involve working with datasets, search algorithms, and color distance calculations.


Performance Optimization:

Implement debouncing or throttling for color generation to optimize performance.
Use Web Workers for intensive calculations to keep the UI responsive.
This introduces you to performance optimization techniques in JavaScript.


Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for your color conversion and generation functions.
Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
This will introduce you to test-driven development and code quality assurance.


Progressive Web App (PWA):

Convert your project into a PWA with offline functionality.
Implement a service worker for caching and offline use.
This will teach you about modern web technologies and app-like experiences on the web.


Internationalization (i18n):

Add support for multiple languages.
Use the Intl API for formatting.
This introduces you to working with localization in JavaScript.


Customizable UI Themes:

Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.
Dynamically generate theme colors based on the selected color.
This will improve your skills in dynamic CSS manipulation and state management.


Export Functionality:

Allow users to export their colors or palettes in various formats (JSON, CSS, SCSS).
Generate shareable links for colors or palettes.
This will teach you about data serialization and URL manipulation.
